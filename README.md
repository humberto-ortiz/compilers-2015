# compilers-2015
Example code for compilers class.

You will need a copy of the example code from the textbook also.

http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/ml/project.html

Code for example problems

 maxargs.sml - a modified exercise, count the maximum number of
 arguments in any constructor for straight line programs. My version
 is buggy. You need to fix it.

 interp.sml - half of a working interpreter for straight line
 programs. You need to implement update and the rest of interpexp and
 interpstm.
